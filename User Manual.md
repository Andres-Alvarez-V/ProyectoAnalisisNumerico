# Welcome to the user's manual.
## To use successfully our program you will have to follow the following steps:
### 1. Download.
From this repository download the files or if you have _git_ use the command _git clone "https://github.com/Andres-Alvarez-V/ProyectoAnalisisNumerico"_
### 2. Library installation. 
You will need to install these python libraries by using the commands written bellow in your terminal:
- _pip install numpy_
- _pip install sympy_
- _pip install tabulate_
### 3. Program executation.
Use the _pyhton.exe_ command followed by the _main.py_ command or run the _main.py_ file.
## Using the program.
After you have completed the above steps, you will be able to find the _Menu_ where are all the methods you can use. To select one of them, write the index of the method that you want to use in the terminal. That will lead you to that method.
### Solution of a linear equations system.
These methods will provide a solution of a linear equations system by usign different types of direct or iterative methods or LU factorization, for that you will need to transform the system into a matrix form.
1. The program will only work with one solution systems, wich means that you can only use a square matrix _A_ and a vector with the same size _b_.
2. Fill in the information of the matrix and the vector as the program indicates.
### Numerical solution of a nonlinear equation.
Fill in the information as the program indicates. To enter a function or a first or second derivative you will need to use the next operators:
- Multiplication: _*_
- Exponentiation: _** / ^_
- Natural logarithm: _log()_
- Exponential function: e
### Interpolation
To do the interpolation enter the known values of _X_ and _Y_ vectors and fill in the information of the vectors as the program indicates.
## WARNING
- The program can only execute one method at time, if you need to use another one or the same method you will have to run the file again or use de command written above.
- If you enter or use the methods in a way that was not described in this file or in the program we can not ensure that the methods will work as they should.
